I hardly find the reason to give a second pass, especilly for C++ and Java.
Also the problem can be easily solved by only O(M) space, where M is the size of numbers set.
So I write this post to let you forget those multi-pass and O(N) space solutions.


```
loop only once on array {
    record the index of first occureence;
    update number counter;
    update result;
}
return result;
```
